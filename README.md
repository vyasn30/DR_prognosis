# Diabetic Retinopathy prognosis
* Objective : To develop a CNN that can correctly classify 5 stages of diabetic retinopathy

# Things done
- Preprocessing
   * We take and image and superimpose it with its grayscale counterpart. T
   * Then perform weighted addition on the image
   * This helps in sharping of the image and making the features stand out

- Training 
    * Yet to experiment with the Neural Networks and come up with our own. 
    * A adjusted Resnet gives 86% accuracy
